## About

He hates mechanical duplication of effort or conformity. He is always concerned about the open source community and new technologies - recently very into the serverless and JAMstack. He learned several programming languages driven by interest and created stuff for fun. He is a fan of minimalist design, mind twisting movies and electronic music. He worked for an online education (start-up) company as a backend developer and now he works for an investment bank in Shanghai.
